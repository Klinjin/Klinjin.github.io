Hi, welcome to my site! As an aspiring researcher in Astrophysics, I harness the power of AI/machine learning to drive new insights into the universe's evolution. With a solid foundation in computational and mathematical engineering, I focus on applying advanced algorithms to real-world problems, from scientific research to innovative industry solutions. After graduating with a Physics B.S. degree with comparative literature minor at UC Santa Barbara, I worked in Prof. Joe Hennawi's [Enigma research group](https://enigma-igm.github.io) with my graduate mentor Molly Wolfson. I started a researcher position at UC Berkeley working with Prof. Uros Seljak. 

Research interests: intergalactic medium, weak lensing, bayesian inference, generative models, uncertainty quantification, optimization tools

Extracurriculum: painting, story-telling, writing, social media, lifting, event hosting
